# JSONCreator
A simple PHP app that can be configured to return JSON

## Explanation
This application is an AngularJS web app that allows users to create JSON using a user friendly front end. At the moment all it creates is a well formatted JSON but future versions will allow for users to save the JSON and create web services to return the JSON so that developers can use the web service for testing purposes.
